# Responsive Layout

This is a simple responsive layout with navbar and footer that's always at the very bottom of the page.
Pages with little content can sometimes imply the footer being displayed before the end of the viewport. The method used here makes sure the footer stays at the bootom even if the total content height is less than the viewport height.
