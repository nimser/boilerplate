## Introduction

> Boilerplate originally referred to the steel plates used in steam boilers, which have become a metaphor for generic or reusable content.

This repo is a data store for reusable code examples that can help me showcase a concept or bootstrap a project/module/component.

Each code example is a runnable dev environment that can be open in Codespace/Gitpod/Devpod. For frontend examples, the environement will open with a Preview panel to immediately see how it renders.

Specific examples may also load additional tools (AI assistants etc...), as specified per the `.devcontainer.json` file (and possibly `Dockerfile`) of each project.

None of this is meant to be reused as such in production. Only use an example if you understand its reason to be. Make accessibility additions, design tweaks, and other adaptations suitable to your specific context.
